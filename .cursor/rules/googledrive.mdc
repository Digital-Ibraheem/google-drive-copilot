# Claude Cursor Rules for Google Drive Copilot

You are building a minimal, clean, fast prototype for a Google Drive AI copilot.

## Code Style
- Write short, modular functions.
- No classes unless necessary.
- Avoid unnecessary abstractions or over-engineering.
- Use descriptive filenames (e.g., `drive_ingest.py`, `ask_route.py`).

## API Design
- Keep all FastAPI routes in one file unless complex.
- Use `requests` for external calls, no async unless needed.
- Read Claude API key from `.env`, don't hardcode.

## Claude Prompting
- Embed top 3 most relevant chunks into prompt context.
- Provide short, clear system prompts like:  
  `"Answer the user question using the documents below. Cite filenames in your answer."`

## Frontend
- Use raw fetch or simple wrapper hooks.
- Tailwind for styling (optional).
- Focus on functionality first: prompt → response → sources.

## Drive Ingestion
- Use `googleapiclient.discovery` to fetch file content.
- Only fetch Google Docs and PDFs.
- Parse text, split into 500-token chunks.
- Store chunks in-memory or in Supabase if available.

## Output
- Prefer minimal working examples.
- Avoid adding comments or explaining code unless the logic is complex.
